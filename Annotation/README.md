# Annotation

Genome annotation using (i) *abinitio* gene prediction using BRAKER/AUGUSTUS, (ii) proteins from H. graminicola, (iii) transcript assembly using Stringtie and (iv) mapping of PacBio HiFi mRNA reads. The different types of evidence were then compined with EVidenceModeler to obtain a final set of gene predictions. 

## Braker/Augustus

Braker was run using the following script:

## Protein mappings

## Stringtie transcripts (short-read mRNA)

## IsoSeq transcripts (PacBioHiFi mRNA reads)

## EVidenceModeler (EVM)
